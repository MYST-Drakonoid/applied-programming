# Number Processor (Erlang)

## Overview

As a software engineer, my goal is to **make people’s lives more pleasant**. Whether that is through games people enjoy or by creating machines or programs that make everyday tasks easier, the medium itself does not matter to me. With my interest in computers and problem-solving, I believe I can make the greatest impact in the digital space.

For this project, I developed a **number-processing program**. The program takes a list of numbers as input and produces a CSV file containing calculated values such as the square, double, triple, and other transformations for each number in the list.

I chose this project because it sounded like a fun and practical way to explore functional programming concepts while working with real data output.

## Development Environment

This project was developed using **Visual Studio Code** as the primary editor.

The program was written in **Erlang**, a functional programming language known for immutable variables, recursion, and reliability. Erlang’s design made it well-suited for processing lists of data in a clear and predictable way. No external libraries were used in this project; all functionality was implemented using Erlang’s built-in features.

## Future Work

While the program meets all the goals I originally set for it, there are still areas that could be expanded in the future:

- Add additional types of numerical processing (such as averages, sums, or filtering rules)
- Allow configurable output formats beyond CSV
- Improve error handling for invalid or empty input lists
