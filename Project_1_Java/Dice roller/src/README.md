# Overview

as a software engineer my goal is to make peoples lives more pleasent. whether that is through games that peopl emay enjoy or through making machines or programs to make life easier it doesnt matter.
i figured that with my love of computers that i could more easily make that difference in the digital space.

i am writing a dice roller program. the purpose of this is that i lov eplaying Dungeons and dragons and i have many friends that also play.
i figued that this would be the easiest way for me to learn multiple concepts quickly while actually making a program

# Development Environment

i do not know much of the tools that i am using besides that it is intellij, a coding enviorment

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}

- [Java SE API Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api)
- [Oracle Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- i need to make sure that the program can handle more than one set of dice in the future, for the moment it can handle one set of dice and one modifier
- i think i need to rewrite the program to use modifiable arrays as they will work better. i only realized this after spending a bunch of time near the end
- the program could also use a better form of string handling that i only learned at the end too
