# Overview

as a software engineer my goal is to make peoples lives more pleasent. whether that is through games that peopl emay enjoy or through making machines or programs to make life easier it doesnt matter.
i figured that with my love of computers that i could more easily make that difference in the digital space.

this program is a hangman program that reads from large list of words and based on the useres declared length chooses a random word.

- the file handleing system for generating the word doesnt work as intended, i would love to get that fixed
- i want the end of the program to operate a bit more effectivly
