# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal is to **make people's lives more pleasant**. Whether that is through games people may enjoy or by creating machines or programs to make life easier, it doesn’t matter. I figured that with my love of computers, I could more easily make a difference in the digital space.

The software I wrote is a D&D 5e Monster Tracker, designed to handle the DM side of combat—attack rolls, damage, ability checks, skill checks, conditions, and other common combat mechanics.

I built this tool because D&D combat can get overwhelming, especially when you’re managing multiple monsters at once. Having a dedicated tool that automates rolls and keeps track of conditions, hit points, and modifiers makes the whole process faster, cleaner, and far less error-prone. This project also gave me hands-on experience with Kotlin, object-oriented design, and building a small desktop UI.

# Development Environment

Development Environment

I developed this project using the IntelliJ IDEA IDE. IntelliJ handled all of the Kotlin project structure, syntax checking, code navigation, and testing features that I needed. It also provided the ability to run the Kotlin/JVM application directly without requiring external build tools.

This project was written in the Kotlin programming language using the JVM backend. For the graphical user interface, I used Java Swing components. Swing works naturally with JVM-based languages and does not require any additional frameworks or installations. This made it a simple way to provide an interface for interacting with the program.

Most of the UI layout and overall structure was generated using GenAI. The UI itself is not part of the assignment’s graded criteria, but it was necessary to run and demonstrate the software effectively. All core logic, data structures, and Kotlin code that handle the program’s features were written manually.

No additional libraries were used aside from the Kotlin standard library and the Swing classes included with the Java Development Kit.

If you want, I can also generate the entire README in one complete block of unformatted plaintext.

# Future Work

- i would like to make the condidtions a selection rather thatn a typed input
- i would liek to make the moster input a bit easier to accomplish
- a more robust UI would be nice
